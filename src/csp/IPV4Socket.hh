        IPV4Socket represents a socket connection that is portable between all
   platforms. The code must all be encapsulated in IPV4Socket.cc and hides any
   implementation details This implementation uses TCP/IP sockets. Eventually a
   corresponding class UDP4Socket will be written for faster Datagrams without
        acknowledgement and a guaranteed delivery system will have to be written
   on top of that. Header files are being moved to .cc so external code does not
   have to deal with the large includes as well as the system specific nature of
   those includes
