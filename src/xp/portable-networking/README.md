# How to build Grail networking subset

```bash
sudo apt install cmake make g++
```

In order to build this code you will need to install cmake (required version is 3.22)
Also required: make g++ toolchain.
This code probably works on windows (should be tested), definitely works on linux

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

```
