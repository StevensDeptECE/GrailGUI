/**
  Represent a client/server socket pair and call a templated handler.

  TODO: For now the handle is a pointer, not templated.  This is slightly
    larger and slower but only by one memory access

  This is envisioned to eventually support the following:

  Protocols: TCP/IP V4, IPV6, UDP, SSL

  The socket base class contains an inline buffer, used to store data
  read from the socket The socket should be agnostic as to the kind of message
  being sent.  The protocol is delegated to the Request class.

  Handlers: HTTP, HTTPS (TLS), CSP, CSPTLS, HTTPMultithreaded
