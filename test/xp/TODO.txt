Maps TODO

1. Filling segments
2. 4-color map (not critical)
3. add methods to draw only one state, one county, ...0.0f
   advantage of sequential regions: texas = 247... 292  as opposed to...  texas is 247, 301, 356, 401-462
4. heatmap: color according to some value
5. area of polygon can be used to sort segments by their area, use biggest one for location of text, this requires storing the index of biggest segment (or sorting)
